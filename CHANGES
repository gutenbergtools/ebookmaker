0.12.x
- replaces Tidy with Beautiful Soup. Ebookmaker has used HTML Tidy to make sure that source files produced over the course of ~ 25 years can be parsed into a reasonably modern HTML DOM. With the advent of HTML5, Tidy has begun to show its age, and maintenance of Tidy has not kept up with the times. Bugs in Tidy are not being fixed, and we find we can no longer rely on Tidy. To replace Tidy, we are using  Beautiful Soup, a very popular python package widely used for web scraping.

Tidy did some other things that caused Ebookmaker's HTML5 output poorly suited for PG,
    - it reorganized style attributes into css style elements. While this made the CSS easier to manage, it resulting in less readable source code.
    - it normalized whitespace in block elements. In almost all cases, this had no effect of the HTML display, many PG contributors have used this whitespace to reproduce the printed pages in the source code, making it easy to maintain.

Beautiful Soup, by contrast, only changes the source when absolutely needed to make parsable unicode  HTML. We expect the resulting HTML5 files will be more pleasing for PG contributors. Some code was added to the Ebookmaker HTML parser to reproduce some of the functionality that Tidy provided.
    - Beautiful soup required some minor modification in error catching for missing files
    - Incoming DOCTYPE is ignored
    - Tidy provided some conversion of obsolete elements/attributes into xhtml4 elements with added CSS Rules.
        - `font` elements are replaced with `span`s.
        - `center` elements are replace by `div`s. See note below about the CSS3 elements needed to reproduce the behavior of the `center` elements.
        - when elements not permitted in as `body` content are present as a child of the `body element, they are wrapped in `div` elements
    - A special formatter for Beautiful soup enforces Unicode Normal Form Composed.

- Ebookmaker has been somewhat heavy-handed when removing deprecated elements and attributes. With this version of Ebookmaker, we make more of an effort to preserve the formatting of the source document. This will impact EPUB2, EPUB3 and HTML5 produced files.
    - size attributes in `font` tags are translated to css rather than ignored.
    - list styles are translated to css rather than ignored.
    - size and width attributes on `hr` are translated to css rather than ignored.
    - width attributes on `hr` are translated to css rather than ignored.
    - deprecated align attributes on most elements are translated to css rather than ignored.
    - bgcolor attributes on elements other than body are translated to css rather than ignored.
    - values for the attributes align, frame, and rules are changed to lower case

- a customization has been added for the cssutils module to permit us to add selected CSS properties we want to use (the built-in tables are getting old.) We needed to do this because certain conversions for obsolete elements could not be duplicated without using newer CSS properties. In particular:
    - to reproduce the legacy `center` element, we added `display: flex` and `justify-content: center`.
    - `speak` and `speak-as` css properties have been updated.

- for HTML5, a validation hook has been added. As with EPUB validation, add the path of your command-line HTML5 validator to the .ebookmaker config file and set the --validate flag. Tested with the W3C "Nu" validator - https://validator.github.io/validator/
- for HTML5, move col@valign to css
- for HTML5, change 3 letter language codes to 2 letter codes where available
- for HTML5, fill empty title elements
- for HTML5, improve handling of HTML4 table@frame and table@rules
- fixed crash in text file analysis when number of lines in paragraph exceeds log(max float). 700-ish
- include opentype fonts in EPUB file (.ttf. .otf, .woff), requires libgutenberg >= 0.8.14. fixes #106
- added an EPUB3 writer. In addition to producing valid EPUB3 files, some changes have been made to the produced EPUB.
    - There in only an "-images" flavor. We continue to produce EPUB2 in images and no-images flavors
    - Many changes in the HTML and CSS that were done for compatibility with e-readers are no longer done. They remain in place for EPUB2. For example: 
        - Floats are not removed.
        - CSS absolute units are not changed.
        - Uncommon characters and ligatures are not simplified.
        - <q> elements are not rewritten.
        - Preformatted sections are not reflowed.
        - data elements are not stripped
        - img class="dropcap" are not changed to spans
        - any of the above that prove to be needed can be added back as needed
        - all html4 -> html5 changes are made, no matter the source.
- Ebookmaker breaks HTML source into chunks to improve performance on EPUB readers. For EPUB3 files, the chunker treats `section` elements the same way it treated `div.section` elements for EPUB2. Similarly section elements in HTML5 source are converted to div.section elements for EPUB2. In addition, the maximum chunk size for EPUB3 is 300KB compared to 100KB for EPUB2.
- Ebookmaker now supports attribute in the epub namespace {http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops} These can be entered in source file in two ways:
    - any `data-epub-*` attribute in an html or xhtml source file is moved to the epub namespace for EPUB2, stripped for EPUB2, and preserved as-is for HTML5. This option will allow permit validation with the W3C 'nu' validator.
    - any 'epub:*' attribute in a properly namespaced XHTML file will be preserved for EPUB3, stripped for EPUB2, and converted to a `data-epub-*` attribute in HTML5.
- This version expands support for accessibility attributes.
    - the epub:role attribute (see above for using the epub namespace)
    - HTML5 attributes `role`, `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` help screen readers interpret HTML. see https://idpf.github.io/epub-guides/epub-aria-authoring/ for guidance about how to use these. Ebookmaker will strip these attributes for EPUB2 files.
    - obsolete values of the `speak` CSS property are now updated to current CSS2/3 equivalents.
    - as discussed above, `speak` and `speak-as` css properties are now included in EPUB, EPUB3 and HTML5 files.
- tibetan (bo) added to list of languages for mobi conversion by calibre
- fixed issue where backlinks required an id set on the original element

0.11.30 December 10, 2021
- for EPUB, down-convert HTML5 tags to divs so the files validate as EPUB2. The new div elements will add a class named the same as the html5 tag, so `<section>` becomes `<div class="section">`. Other attributes are preserved. In addition CSS selectors involving these elements will be transformed accordingly: for example `section` becomes `div.section`
    - `section`
    - `figure`  (initial style set to "margin: 1em 40px;",  copying from Firefox internal stylesheet.)
    - `figcaption`
    - `header`
    - `footer`
Users of these HTML5-only tags need to check that their CSS does not conflict with the added classes or changed CSS. In almost all cases, avoiding HTML5 element names for CSS classes will prevent any conflict. Users of HTML5 input may still encounter unresolved issues with other parts of the DP/PG tool chain; please examine output files carefully for unexpected behavior.
- for EPUB, move 'tfoot' elements to before 'tbody' (the order used in HTML4)
- for EPUB, remove any 'meta' elements using the 'property' attribute.
- add 'CRITICAL' notification for 'too-deep' errors
- reset parsers after txt jobs. fixes a bug when the plain text source file is linked from the html.
- EPUBCheck validation was broken. To use EPUBCheck validation, first download and install EPUBCheck from https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/. If the command to invoke it is  `java -jar /Applications/epubcheck-4.2.6/epubcheck.jar`, then add this line to ~/.ebookmaker or /etc/ebookmaker.conf: `epub_validator: java -jar /Applications/epubcheck-4.2.6/epubcheck.jar` then turn on validation by adding `--validate` to Ebookmaker's command line invocation or by setting validate to true in ~/.ebookmaker


0.11.29 November 30, 2021
- for HTML5, remove Content-Language metas
- when converting a presentational attribute to css in a style attribute, put the added css *before* existing content of the style, so as not to override it. this mimics browser behavior for cases when the two styles conflict. This won't do much good right away because tidy strips the styles into named classes.
- stop adding a viewport meta tag. it turns out this interferes with good HTML5 designs for mobile.


0.11.28 November 24, 2021
- fix #100. the behavior of --output-file has changed. a string passed using this argument is used to name the file where the Gutenberg ID would be. Previously it would be just the name of the output file, no matter the file type, except for Kindle, PDF and TeX. File naming for kindle was broken completely. In the past (version <0.11) --title would override the parsed or looked-up title. Title would be used in the file name if there was no Gutenberg id, or --outputfile.  
- docutils rst conversion introduced a typo in 0.18 resulting in some css problems
- added exception handling in ImageParser for broken images
- don't select cover until it's needed. Ebookmaker has been generating unneeded covers in the txt step because it hasn't parsed an html file.
- for HTML5, fixed a css syntax error in the css added for the table@cols attribute
- for HTML5, make sure lang and xml:lang attributes are in sync; put invalid langs in data-invalid-lang attribute.
- for HTML5, remove height or width attributes that are 0 or empty


0.11.27 November 18, 2021
- one more fix for docutils 0.18+

0.11.26 November 11, 2021
- fixed a problem with covers selected from linked images based on the file name. (The image file would be added twice).
- fixed a problem with linked images being omitted if they also were used as the cover image
- cover images are stripped from the flow because they are re-added to the flow in the coverpages. This behavior can now be over-ridden with the x-ebookmaker-important class (as has been advertised).
- added `--config-dir` command line argument to help guiguts integrate the included tidy config file.
- update docutils to 0.18+
- fixed a problem with noimages files with caused by the parsing for .images jobs. Build order reversed!
- fixed a problem with noimages files due to broken link removal
- changed file naming methods so that Calibre file checking no longer complains.
- 0.11.25 was not deployed due to test failures.


0.11.24 November 8, 2021
- compatibility with docutils 0.18+. docutils' node traversal was changed from a list to an iterator.
- fixed duplicated generated cover bug. This caused errors in epubs generated by Online Ebookmaker or when the source directory is the same as the target directory.
- fix entities in generated CSS. When we generate HTML from txt or rst we must not entify '>'
- fix problem when an html source file links to a text file. Ebookmaker was trying to convert these files to html, and including them in the ebook reading order. Now, linked plain text files are only converted to utf8, nothing more.
- make sure that every img element has an alt attribute
- replace obsolete attributes for HTML5: td@background, td@bordercolor, tr@bordercolor, table@bordercolor, table@height, table@background background (the last one was never a thing!)
- remove blink elements
- add missing dd elements
- make sure that lang attribute == xml:lang attributes, everywhere.
- fix issue with <CR> in metadata when setting title for conversion from text files
- update to libgutenberg 0.8.12 to fix issue with control characters in dc.title meta tags


0.11.23 October 28, 2021
- moves tfoot to end of tables for HTML5
- removes superfluous span attributes in tables for HTML5
- replaces frame and rules attributes in tables with equivalent css for HTML5
- checks all values of the lang and xml:lang attributes for validity, fixes common invalid values for HTML5
- fix thead@align, tfoot@align, thead@valign, tfoot@valign for HTML5

0.11.21 October 23, 2021
- fixed file scanner to not scan parent directory when asked to scan a directory

0.11.20 October 22, 2021
- fixed file scanner used to find covers

0.11.19 October 21, 2021
- tt elements replaced by span with monospace font in HTML5
- newlines properly escaped in meta attributes
- removes meta elements with scheme attribute
- fixed missing coverpages in epub


0.11.18 October 19, 2021
- fixed reversion in TeX conversion

0.11.17 October 18, 2021
- fixed missing subtype in link rel setter


0.11.16 October 15, 2021
- fixed cover setting issues in 0.11.15
- parser now converts unicode to Normal Form C. So "A"+"combining-`" -> "À"
- CSS serializer now omits invalid CSS properties in the derived HTML5. CSS profile used in CSS2, and includes a small number of properties that are marked as errors by the HTML5 validator because it considers them deprecated by CSS3 (for example, the "speak" property, which is replaced by "speak-as") We'll need to move to CSS3 eventually, but for now we need to also target EPUB2 and ereaders that don't do CSS3 yet. The supported CSS Properties are defined by profiles in the cssutils module in python; CSS3 properties are somewhat modular, and there needs to be discussion around which properties we should be using in PG files.


0.11.15 October 14, 2021
Not deployed due to test failures
- fix syntax and position of style element replacing HTML5 deprecated elements
- remove xml:space from HTML5 pre and style elements
- make removal of http-equiv meta elements case-insensitive
- try to remove problematic carriage returns in meta tags
- tr@align, tr@valign, tbody@align, tbody@valign changed to css equivalents
- remove img@longdesc; it never did anything
- add title to files produced from txt
- to allow for better HTML5 validation the preferred mechanism for denoting a cover image has been changed from `<link rel="coverpage" type href="a_relative_url.jpg" />` to `<link rel="icon" href="a_relative_url.jpg" type="image/x-cover" />`. type is optional unless there is more than one link@rel=icon. The issue is that "coverpage" is not an HTML5-registered link relation. The registered "icon" relation is described as "Imports an icon to represent the document." The "coverpage" mechanism will continue to be supported and does not need to be changed, especially for XHMTL source files.
- Ebookmaker now looks for unlinked cover files if there are none linked. Cover file names must contain the string "cover" and must an extension in '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', or '.gif'. Cover files must be in the same directory as the source file or one of its subdirectories. At some time in the past, cover files for display on the website were similarly identified by name. Some covers in the backfile were replaced by generated files when Ebookmaker added the capability of generating cover files. With Ebookmaker now identifying cover files, many of the unlinked covers should be restored. When a cover file is supplied, it is still a best practice to use a link element in the html file.
- adds utility functions CommonCode.dir_from_url and CommonCode.find_candidates to refactor directory walking and url to path conversions


0.11.14 October 11, 2021
- fix error when a style element is empty
- fix error when style contains non-ascii text
- fix issue with aux files not being copied to html destination
- use secure version of Pillow


0.11.13 September 30, 2021
- fix reversion in 0.11.10 leaving out added meta elements
- remove encoding meta element originating in HTML5 source from EPUB2 files, as it was causing validation failures.
- remove @media handheld rules for HTML
- move content of table summary attribute to data-summary attribute
- width attribute on table and col is converted to css in a style attribute
- non-integer width or height on img is converted to css in a style attribute
- fixed epub builds for books with images in external css sheets
- the 'big' element is obsolete; changed to <span class="xhtml_big">. css is altered or added as appropriate
- a number of table attributes are obsolete in html5 and changed to the corresponding css styles: table@width, col@width, table@cellpadding, table@cellspacing, table@border, td@align, th@align, td@valign, th@valign
- html5 doesn't allow elision of dd in dl. Where they are missing, we add empty dd
- html5 doesn't permit carriage returns. these are replace by newlines when represented as numeric entities.
- libgutenberg dependency updated to 0.8.11
    - fix issue of polymorphism in dc.languages. Without a db, it's a list of structs; with a db, its a related collection.
    - ebookmaker will no longer ignore xml:lang or DC meta attributes
    - fix windows path comparison - ebookmaker will behave properly when input file is in outputdir
- fixed style element bug in unreleased 0.11.12


0.11.11 September 22, 2021
- remove encoding meta element originating in HTML5 source from EPUB2 files, as it was causing validation failures.
- fix bug when an XHTML source file set an xml:lang attribute


0.11.10 September 20, 2021
- use tidy for _all_ html source files
- addressed long-standing issue where images referenced in css were not included in epubs. This issue surfaced because the images were also missing from generated files.
- addressed some simple issues preventing derived HTML5 files from validating. More complex issues involving incompatibilities between XHTML and HTML5 have been enumerated and will be addressed in subsequent updates.
    - removed http-equiv meta elements for Content-Type and Content-Style-Type
    - set lang attribute when xml:lang attribute is present
    - removed duplicate encoding meta elements introduced by HTML5 source.
    - removed type attribute from style elements
- update requirements so that stand-alone installs will work better


0.11.9 September 3, 2021
- more aggressive session closing

0.11.8 September 2, 2021
- fix crash when source document contains html comments

0.11.7 September 2, 2021
- Using libgutenberg 0.8.7, which includes the type of meta tags used in HTML5.
- Ebookmaker was not saving the derived HTML files if the main source file was in the output directory. This prevented online Ebookmaker to from displaying the files. Now, Ebookmaker will put derived files in an "out" directory. This turned out to require some code restructuring.
- The pseudo-xhtml files produced by 0.11.5 were cause problems with browser compatibility, most noticeably by doubling break elements. It turns out that the quirky output from lxml was caused by xml namespacing of elements. when xml namespaces were removed, the html output method worked as desired, resulting in files that in many cases validated as html5. This solved a number of problems for us, and puts us in a position to start remediating problem files in the backfile in preparation for EPUB3.
- The encoding for all python source files was changed to UTF8. A mis-encoded python file caused a problem with mdashes in titles.
- Sessions are now closed after every set of jobs. Ebookconverter was running out of Databse connections.
- Some superfluous logging was removed.
- There is documentation for the changes introduced in version 0.11

0.11.5 August 28, 2021
- fix bug in stand-alone kindle generation

0.11.4 August 26, 2021
- one more change. can't use xml write mode for html, because Chrome and Safari no longer support self-closing tags.

0.11.3 August 18. 2021
Adds notification support
- Add queue_notifications method in CommonCode, usable by both EbookConverter and EbookMaker
- configure notifications for missing file problems
- remove parsers for missing files - bug exposed by html generation
- fixed regression in WrapperParser
- add coverage by test file 
- enhanced log formatting
- refactored log setup for use with 
- started using CRITICAL logs to trigger notifications

0.11.2 August 4. 2021
Bugfixes for stand-alone use. We should not have released 0.11.1  on pypi.

- Ebookmaker 0.11.1 did not work without psycopg2 and the PG database. Neither did libgutenberg 0.7.2. This version, with libgutenberg 0.8.1, works without the PG database or psycopg2.
- uses libcountry for language name lists.
- uses old dc object if database not present


0.11.1 July 19. 2021
Fixes for Ebookconverter compatibility. 0.11.0 was never deployed.

- stop using old dc object, no use only ORM for db access
- since the ORM dc object contains a session, it can't be pickled. But EbookConverter sends a pickled job queue to EbookConverter to process, presumably to enable processing on multiple servers. So job queues no longer can contain dc objects. EbookMaker now gets a new (ORM) dc object for every job. 
- when making txt output, EBM was relying on not also generating html except for rst. so now we check directly for txt source when creating.
- assorted delinting



0.11.0 June 30. 2021
Ebookmaker version 0.11 makes enhanced HTML files for all types of input, including HTML source files. Here are the improvements and other changes made to HTML source:

- all HTML files are cleaned by HTML Tidy. Tidy does the following:
    - converts all HTML to well-formed UTF8-encoded XHTML files. This will allow the PG server to add encoding to MIME headers, improving browser compatibility and accessibility.
    - LF is used as the newline character for all files (unix standard)
    - html entities such as "`&rsquo;`" `&Aacute;` etc. are converted to unicode characters
    - correct badly formed HTML, improving browser compatibility and standards conformance.
    - Because the files are now guaranteed to be well-formed, DOM manipulation can be done reliably by browser plugins, mobile apps, proxy servers, accessibility tools and PG's own file processors.
    - inline style attributes are moved to a generated inline stylesheet for better rendering performance.
    - a doctype declaration for XHTML+RDFa 1.1 is used for all files to allow validation with included RDFa metadata.
    - tags are now uniformly lower case
    - some legacy presentational tags (`<i>,` `<b>`, `<center>` when enclosed within appropriate inline tags, and <font>) are replaced with CSS <style> tags and structural markup as appropriate.
    - empty paragraphs are discarded.
    - any text in the body element is wrapped in a `<p>` element.
- added RDFa data, Dublin Core, and schema.org metadata to head element of HTML for better SEO and facebook unfurls. Changes in the metadata are now reflected in the HTML presentation

Some incidental changes were necessary to make this possible:
- Because the generated html is moved to a new directory, linked files also needed to be moved.
- Because the generated file has a different name, back-links needed to be changed

It is possible that rendering of the HTML is changed by this additional processing; however, the changed rendering would be aligned aligned with what has long existed in PG EPUB files. 

Note that the unprocessed source files will continue to be available without URL change on the PG web site.

- Don't stop generating html with first html file.
- Don't generate wrapper files when spidering to generate html
- Move @media handling to EpubWriter, not in parser.
- Also copy css and images to target directory
- Don't rewrite urls on output; they're already relative
- Let Spider follow "nofollow" links; instead have EpubWriter remove the nofollow links and corresponding files
- added USAGE.md to provide better documentation for html authors preparing files for Ebookmaker
- removed data-* attributes for epub because these attributes are not allowed in EPUB 2.0.1 and files were thus failing EpubCheck
- add RDFa data and schema.org metadata to head element of generated HTML for better SEO and facebook unfurls
- now using the doctype declaration for XHTML+RDFa 1.1 for generated HTML from libgutenberg >= 0.7.1
- added a tidy config to eliminate dependence on system configured tidy and to turn off drop-empty-elements, an option not available at the command line. Dropping empty spans/divs was having unexpected effects on css rendering; easily worked around, but confusing for producers.

Boilerplate generation will follow in v0.12


0.10.4 April 6, 2021
- add a minimal css stylesheet to the html generated for txt files
- delint

0.10.3 February 25, 2021
- added rendering for <q>: ebookmaker will now change all <q> tags to <span> for epub builds, keeping any attributes on the tags. curly quotes will be added inside the spans, double for top level q and single for all q nest in other qs.

0.10.2 January 18, 2021
- corrected text in PG footer for RST - thanks Roger Frank. Note that boilerplate generation is being revised for v0.11
- when reflowing pre, don't make it one long line. This was causing problems in the Kobo reader.
- don't drop a heading that starts with "by " if class 'x-ebookmaker-important' is on it.
- also log headings that are dropped because they start with "by "
- fix bug in anchor fixing where if an <a> tag had both id and name attributes, both were deleted.
- delinting

0.10.1 November 25, 2020
- fixed minor issue where "too deep" errors were emitted for self-links. Thanks to rfrank for the error report.
- fixed deprecation warning from Docutils; should be ok for Docutils > 0.1 

0.10.0 November 2, 2020
- SVG files are now considered images and included in EPUBs. They were being discarded. SVG files are not scaled or compressed by ebookmaker - the renderer should be able to auto-scale. This appears to fix kindlegen failures associated with svg images.
- fixed the rst test


0.9.7 September 14, 2020
- changed font for rst conversion. Linux Libertine was unmaintained since 2012 and no package was available for CENTOS8. We switched to the closest replacement, Libertinus https://github.com/alerque/libertinus
- added documentation about configuration for rst conversion
- the deprecated 'handheld' @media query was being used to prevent ebookmaker from stripping floats. to preserve this feature, ebookmaker no longer strips floats when the css selector contains the x-ebookmaker class. Most likely, float stripping was originally needed because html pages were designed before the advent of EPUB. Today, we can assume that if the html designer uses the x-ebookmaker class, they've considered the impact of the float on the generated EPUB.
- assorted delinting

0.9.6 September 8, 2020
- added 'x-ebookmaker' class to epub body elements. There are now 4 "x-ebookmaker" classes
    - css can now apply styles that are triggered by being a descendent of .x-ebookmaker. This addition is meant to replace the 'handheld' @media query that is deprecated in HTML 5
    - the 'x-ebookmaker-important' class on on image element tells ebookmaker not to remove the image, even in no-images builds.
    - the 'x-ebookmaker-drop' class tells ebookmaker to remove an element and its descendents from ebook builds.
    - the 'x-ebookmaker-pageno' class is applied to some span elements whose content has been stripped because they use a class that indicates they represent page numbers: pagenum pageno page pb folionum foliono
- added mayan as a language not supported by kindlegen
- typos fixed in README - thanks Joseph Koshy

0.9.5 July 6, 2020
- fixed minor issue where the spider was getting confused when iterating on WrapperParsers.

0.9.4 June 30, 2020
- handle invalid quantization table in jpeg files when using quality 'keep'
- respect rel="nofollow" attribute: this allows authors to link to an alternate version file in html without duplicating content in the EPUB file.
- set wrappers to nonlinear in spine.
- fixed bugs and ugliness in toc generation
  - when the same header level is consecutive, only one toc item is generated. (We see this used to make multiline heads or titles)
  - toc normalization made a hash of the toc. Now the toc is normalized in the epubwriter, not in the parser.
  - add display:block to standard css sheet to prevent hidden headings from breaking kindlegen
- added a configuration option to use calibre (or whatever!) for non-supported in kindleget languages.

0.9.3 June 23, 2020
- Fix reversion in 0.9.2 which caused CoverWriter in EbookConverter to fail. (It uses ImageParser to convert images from PNG to JPEG
- add a test to check this

0.9.2 June 19, 2020
- note that EbookMaker is no longer installable in Python 2.7 (thanks cpeel)
- clean up pipfile and gitignore pipfile.lock (thanks cpeel)
- fixed bug where filepaths need escape in HTML
- fixed issue where compression was expanding compressed jpegs (thanks choward)
- adde EBOK flag in MOBI when using ebook-convert (thanks rfrank)

0.9.1 June 11, 2020
Minor bug fix and optimization.
- picsdir builds weren't recognizing when it was copying files to themselves
- "broken" images are now inserted when an image is missing
- title attribute in wrappers needed escaping
- build times are now reported to logs
- small optimization with preparse on image parsers

0.9.0 June 2, 2020
Image handling has changed starting with 0.9
- linked images (image files as targets of links) are now wrapped in html, fixing display in ADE.
- linked images are compressed to 1MB if possible (changed from 128K)
- inline images are compressed to 256K if possible (changed from 128K)
- all images are limited to 5000x5000 pixels (was 800 x 1280)
- PNG images are scaled to meet the image filesize targets (previously no scaling of PNG images)
- L format JPEG images (greyscale) are no longer converter to RBG (thanks rfrank)
- generated covers are now 1200 x 1800
- covers and "important" images in noimages builds are scaled to 64K (previously no scaling)

General bug fixes
- eliminated double parsing due to first pass using raw paths
- when tidy fails, the (huge) error trace is only logged once.
- generated html is no longer overwritten by empty results


0.8.12 May 5, 2020
- corrected the exception to catch for missing files

0.8.11 May 4, 2020
- It turns out that ebookmaker gets called both with bare paths and file: urls depending on ebookconverter config files. So 0.8.10 broke on the production machine, though it seemed just fine on mac and windows. So we went back to the drawing board to figure out how to support posix and windows, with or without windows mount points (not sure if that's the right term), file:/// urls and bare paths. We also figured out some issues involving spaces in paths.

0.8.10 April 30, 2020
- fixed numerous file path nits on Windows
    - kindlegen
    - figsdir
    - cover
    - pdf
- PEP8 delinted:
    - EbookMaker.py
    - ParserFactory.py
    - Spider.py
    - parsers/__init__.py
    - writers/EpubWriter.py

0.8.9 April 13, 2020
- fixed issues preventing successful deployments on Windows
- added logging for books deeper than max_depth
- improved documentation for tidy and cairo prerequisites
- try to catch  and report exceptions when tidy and cairo aren't installed
- added install-on-windows notes

0.8.8 March 6, 2020
- fixed issue preventing chunking when text file is latin-1
- fixed failure when source links to a directory
- improved parse error message

0.8.7 February 10, 2020
- fixed issue causing failed build when file encoding doesn't match plateform default
- fixed issue where cover set on command line is excluded in build.

0.8.6 February 6, 2020
- fixed issue where covers aren't set when source is txt

0.8.5 January 27, 2020
- set "huge_tree" attribute for the xml parser to keep big files from blocking a build

0.8.4 January 23, 2020
- fixed bugs in rst->tex conversion
    - class = 'medium' extra '}'
    - removed '%' in noindent

0.8.3 January 21, 2020
- fixed bug exposed by setting cover with a command line argument

0.8.2 January 16, 2020
- refined embedded media error message to include referrer
- added external link warning

0.8.1 January 15, 2020
- Ebookmaker has been downloading and including in epubs embedded media from arbitrary websites, for example, images. This has caused build errors when a remote site goes away. ebookmaker has command line parameters that allow include and exclude urls that have governed document files; these same rules now apply to media files.

  In general, PG books should not embed media from other sites.

0.8.0 January 10, 2020
- support ebook-convert tool from Calibre as alternative to kindlegen

    To use calibre instead of kindlegen

    1. install calibre
    2. change MOBIGEN setting to 'ebook-convert' or the path to ebook-convert

0.7.10 January 9, 2020

- build failures on our production system suggest that the parser's output for empty style elements may be os-dependent. Parser now handles style elements with null text.
- allow the build to succeed even if a css file is missing
- allow px only in border properties. see discussion below
- fix false encoding error (complaining about "Klingon") when content file is missing

Ebookmaker has been removing any css rules that use 'px' measurements. 'px' measurements are discouraged in css styles for epub because of poor scaling when user changes font size. However fixed lengths are still useful in properties such as table borders. see discussion on DP forum:
https://www.pgdp.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=41237&p=1188773&hilit=windymilla#p1188746

0.7.9 January 6, 2020
